# Airline Booking System

Hey there! 👋 This is my C++ project for an Airline Booking System that I created as part of my Data Structures and Algorithms course. It's a console-based application that lets you manage flights and bookings - pretty cool, right?

## What's Inside? 🎯

### For Admins:
- Add/remove flights
- Create new routes between cities
- Check all bookings
- Manage flight delays
- See all available routes and flights

### For Users:
- Book flights
- See what flights are available
- Check your booking history
- Manage your bookings

## How I Built It 🛠️

I used:
- C++ (my favorite programming language!)
- Graph data structure (for managing routes between cities)
- Object-Oriented Programming concepts
- Visual Studio for development

## Project Files 📁

```
dsaP/
├── main.cpp          # Where all the magic happens!
├── customer.h/cpp    # Handles user accounts
├── flight.h/cpp      # Manages flight details
├── graph.h/cpp       # Takes care of routes
└── ticket.h/cpp      # Handles booking tickets
```

## How to Run It 🚀

1. Make sure you have Visual Studio installed
2. Open `dsaP.sln`
3. Hit F5 to run!

### Admin Login (for testing):
- Username: admin
- Password: 1234

## Cool Features I Added ✨

### Route System
- Cities are connected like a network
- You can find the best route between any two cities
- Multiple routes possible between cities

### Flight Management
- Each flight has its own ID
- Tracks available seats
- Shows departure and arrival times
- Can handle flight delays

### Booking System
- Easy to book flights
- Keeps track of all your bookings
- Shows seat availability

## What I Learned 📚

While building this project, I learned a lot about:
- Graph data structures
- Object-Oriented Programming
- File handling
- User interface design
- Error handling

## Future Improvements 🎯

I'm thinking of adding:
- A proper GUI
- More payment options
- Better error messages
- More cities and routes

Feel free to check out my code and let me know what you think! Any suggestions for improvements are welcome! 😊

## Note 📝

This is a student project, so it might not be perfect, but I'm proud of what I've built! Feel free to use it as a reference for your own projects.
